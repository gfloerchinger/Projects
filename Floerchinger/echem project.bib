	abstract = {Ceres Power Ltd. has developed a novel solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) concept based upon depositing a thick film positive–electrolyte–negative (PEN) structure on a porous stainless steel substrate, and using gadolinia-doped ceria (CGO) as the electrolyte material. This approach allows the temperature of operation to be reduced to below 600 °C, well below the conventional SOFC operating temperature. Historically, the use of CGO as an electrolyte material has been viewed as impractical because of its poor stability in reducing atmospheres at elevated temperatures, leading to electronic conductivity, which effectively short-circuits the cell leading to a loss of efficiency. In this work, a model is developed which accurately simulates the polarisation behaviour of a Ceres cell including electronic leakage. The parameters of this model are set to give the best possible fit to experimental data. This cell model is then incorporated into a model of a 2.5 kWe stack, and the stack model into a natural gas fuelled combined heat and power (CHP) system model. The system model demonstrates that high operating efficiencies are achievable for such a system based upon IT-SOFC cells with CGO electrolytes.},

	abstract = {The hybrid power plant project at DLR aims at investigating the fundamentals and requirements of a combined fuel cell and gas turbine power plant. A specific aim is to demonstrate stable operation of a plant in the 50kW class. Prerequisite for the power plant realization is the detailed characterization of each subsystem and their interactions. The pressurized solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is an essential part of one main subsystem. A combined theoretical and experimental approach allows a thorough insight into nonlinear behavior. This paper focuses on the influence of pressurization on SOFC performance in the range from 1.4 to 3bar. Conclusions are based on experimental V(i)-characteristics as well as on overpotentials derived from elementary kinetic models. Experiments are performed on planar, anode-supported 5-cell short stacks. The performance increases from 284mWcm−2 at 1.4bar to 307mWcm−2 at 2bar and 323mWcm−2 at 3bar (at 0.9V; anode: H2/N2 1/1; cathode: air; temperature: 800°C). The benefit of a temperature rise increases at elevated pressures. Moreover, the effect of gas variation is enhanced at higher pressures. The main conclusion is that pressurization improves the performance. Due to different effects interfering, operation of pressurized SOFC requires further detailed analysis.},

A generic solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) system model is described that is specifically developed for the evaluation of building integrated co- or polygeneration. First, a detailed computational cell model is developed for a planar SOFC and validated with available numerical and experimental data for intermediate and high temperature SOFCs with internal reforming (IT-DIR and HT-DIR). Results of sensitivity analyses on fuel utilisation and air excess ratio are given. Second, the cell model is extended to the stack model, considering stack pressure losses and the radiative heat transfer effect from the stack to the air flow. Third, two system designs based on the IT-DIR and HT-DIR SOFCs are modelled. Electric and CHP efficiencies are given for the two systems, as well as performance characteristics, to be used in simulations of building integrated co- and polygeneration systems.},

	abstract = {Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are electrochemical conversion devices, which essentially consist of two porous electrodes separated by a dense, oxide ion conducting electrolyte. The performance and the durability of SOFCs strongly depend on the electrode microstructure. In this paper, the impact of a relatively long exposure time (up to 20 000 h) under realistic operation terms (temperature (T) = 850 °C, current density (J) = 190–250 mA cm−2) in the kinetics of microstructural degradation are investigated for porous nickel (Ni)/ceria gadolinium oxide (CGO) anodes, to understand the microstructural evolution in SOFC cermet anodes. A combined system of Focused Ion Beam (FIB) and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) tomography was used to analyze various anode microstructures aged during different operating times (2500 h, 15 000 h and 20 000 h). The methodologies of image acquisition as well as the segmentation and the object recognition were improved, offering a reliable quantification of Ni-grain growth, connectivity, tortuosity factor and triple phase boundary length (TPBL). The representative volume element (RVE) was also studied, and its dependence on aging time was confirmed. To construct a volume that can be accurate and representative for the whole sample, the necessary corresponding 3D reconstruction size was adjusted by increasing operating time, in order to suppress the influence of microstructure variation caused by Ni and CGO agglomeration. Statistically significant 3D microstructural changes were observed in the anode by increasing the operating time, including nickel particle size distribution, changes in connectivity of the ceramic part (CGO) and a significant decrease of contiguous triple phase boundary densities. Additional qualitative observations were done in order to gain a complete insight of the degradation phenomena in nickel based cermet anodes.},

Internal heat exchange coefficients have been calculated with a specific fluid-dynamic finite volume analysis.

The model generates total cell balances and internal cell profiles for any relevant thermodynamic or electrochemical variable, giving the possibility of discussing the effects of different operating conditions on the internal FC behavior.

	abstract = {The need for electrical energy storage (EES) is being driven by the deployment of increasing amounts of intermittent renewable energy resources. In addition to their fuel flexibility, high efficiency, scalability, and long-term cost outlook, reversible (regenerative) solid oxide cell (rSOC) systems have the potential for round-trip efficiencies competitive with the other available energy storage technologies. Accordingly, the focus of the current study is to investigate modeling methods for high temperature rSOCs in order to facilitate future endeavors related to establishing optimal operating conditions and system designs. Previously developed solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and solid-oxide electrolytic cell (SOEC) models are integrated to form a general rSOC model. The model is first calibrated and validated based on the available experimental data in the extant literature. The validation results show that the fitting parameters extracted from the calibration study can precisely simulate the cell behavior under various operating conditions. The effects of key operating parameters, such as temperature, gas composition and fuel utilization, on the voltage–current density performance characteristic and thermoneutral voltage are then investigated. It is also observed that the total electrochemical losses of the cell can be significantly different in each operating mode (fuel cell and electrolyzing) under certain operating conditions. Advantages of pressurized operation on thermal management are also discussed.},

One-step anodes fired at 1450°C showed an area specific resistance of 0.15Ωcm2 under open circuit conditions and an anodic overpotential of 91mV at 750°C for a current density of 322mA/cm2, which are amongst the best results mentioned in the literature. The enhanced electrochemical performance of one-step anodes is mainly attributed to unique microstructural features, namely small grain size (submicrometer scale even after firing at 1450°C) and homogeneous phase distribution, which is expected to extend the triple-phase boundary length.},
